#establish a need list. STart with 1 "FUEL"
#search the reactant half for items in the need list. When you get a hit, add the reactor half to the need list and subtract the reactant half from the need list.
#Any remainder from a reaction should go onto the surplus list.
#Always take from surplus before checking the reaction list for the item needed.
#When the need list is empty except for ORE, count the ORE needed.
